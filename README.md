## Project 1: OFDM Communication system

This project consists of the simulation, analysis and DSP implementation of a OFDM communication system.

This project contains MATLAB simulation that enables detailed analysis and C code used for testing into a real DSP-board. 

The project addresses the following problems:
1. signal encoding/decoding from the bit stream to symbols
2. conversion to an analogue coding/decoding technique; orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
3. transmission channel equalization
4. modulation/demodulation of the signal to/from a frequency band suited for acoustic transmission
5. interpolation/decimation to convert the signal between different sampling rates in
the system



## Project 2: Noise Cancellation using LMS algorithm

The purpose of this project is to learn how to implement and use an adaptive filter algorithm: the least mean squares algorithm (LMS).

The task is to implement and study properties of the LMS algorithm on the same platform that was used for Project 1A (i.e. the DSP-kit). The particular application which we are targeting here is noise cancellation.

1. Part A: Implement the LMS algorithm and test it.
2. Part B: Investigate the properties of the LMS filter applied to the active noise cancellation problem.
