% Perform the following steps:
%   1) In student_sols.m, update the student_id variable as described
%   there.
%
%   2) In student_sols.m, complete all the partially-complete functions.
%   (Indicated by a '%TODO: ...' comment). Note that all the functions you
%   need to complete are located in student_sols.m (and only in
%   student_sols.m). You can test these functions by running this file,
%   which will apply a self-test to your functions. When all functions pass
%   the self-test, a unique password will be printed in the terminal. Be
%   sure to include this password in your submission.
%
%   3) Now that the functions in student_sols.m are completed, continue
%   working with this file. Notably, your finished functions will be used
%   to evaluate the behavior of the assignment.

%                    Note on function handles
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
% In this file, we will make use of function handles. A function handle is
% a variable that refers to a function. For example:
%
% x = @plot
%
% assigns a handle to the plot function to the variable x. This allows to
% for example do something like
%
% x(sin(linspace(0,2*pi)))
%
% to call the plot function. Usefully for you, there exist function handles
% to all the functions you've written in student_sols.m. See below for
% exactly how to call them in this assignment.
%
%
% Final note: files with a .p extension are intentionally obfusticated
% (they cannot easily be read). These files contain the solutions to the
% tasks you are to solve (and are used in order to self-test your code).
% Though it is theoretically possible to break into them and extract the
% solutions, doing this will take you *much* longer than just solving the
% posed tasks =)
